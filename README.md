<h1>0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O</h1>
<p>A project done in C programming as part of the requirment in the ALX SWE program. The aim is to understand and implement sorting algorithms of different types and also, to be able to evaluate or determine the big O notations of the time complexity of each sort algorithm:</p>
<li>
<ul>in the best case</ul>
<ul>in the average case</ul>
<ul>in the worst case</ul>
</li>
<p>In this project, we also learned how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input</p>
